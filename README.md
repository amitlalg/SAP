# Sap-Samples
This repository contains samples for SAP integration via Azure Logic App's SAP connector.
There is a PowerPoint Presentation at the root folder explaining how the XML are composed.
There are subfolders for each type of integration - RFC, BAPI and IDOC.

Anyone is welcome to submit additional samples. Preferrably explain what the sample is about. Do not include any PII (Personally Identifiable Information, e.g. e-mails) in the samples.
